# INFINITY PACER

## The open source pacemaker-defibrillator


- **Private and Secure**: free and open source hardware and software free of conflicts of interest -- no proporietary lock-in or encryption backk-door
- **Encrypted**: Secure closed-circuit journaled monitoring system with zero-knowledge end-to-end encrypted backend
- **'Hack-proof'**: Source code open for community-wide auditing to prevent vulnerabilities, moderated pull requests for bug fixes or newly discovered vulnerabilities (a significant advantage over proprietary devices)
- **Fault-tolerant**: multiple backup batteries with secure alerts, blockchained journaling of all events
- **All-Purpose**: Single- or dual-chamber device with an adaptive activity-sensing accelerometer; both a pacemaker and a defibrillator
- **Convenient**: Can be worn in an MRI machine, through metal detectors, and around other electronics safely
- **Future-Proof**: Secure encrypted firmware updating
- **Rechargeable**: Precordial remote charging - Recharge the battery through the skin once every 5 years (or more often depending on the number of cardioverter-defibrillator events), no additional  operations required
- **Robust and Rugid**: Designed to outlive the host

This device is a pacemaker, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), and a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device rolled into one designed to be rechargeable so that only one surgical operation by an electrophysiologist is needed for the lifetime of the device. The Infinity Pacer is designed for multiple therapeutic uses in treating cardiac arrhythmias and is designed to be a one-size-fits-all device for treating most cardiac arrhythmias and conditions. It is designed to be non-proprietary so that any device company in any country can manage the device securely with remote encrypted updates, monitoring, and recharging. The source code and hardware schematics are meant to be published as 'open source' for widespread auditing for experts in any field to inspect and contribute to the code in order create a uniquely secure and bug-free device.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome. Currently, device manufacturers are needed. This project is still in its pre-alpha stage and is very much still a proof of conccept.

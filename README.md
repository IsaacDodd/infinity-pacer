The open source pacemaker-defibrillator
==================================================

- **Private and Secure**: free and open source hardware and software free of conflicts of interest
- **Encrypted**: Secure closed-circuit journaled monitoring system with zero-knowledge end-to-end encrypted backend
- **Unhackable**: Source code open for community-wide auditing to prevent vulnerabilities
- **Fault-tolerant**: backup batteries with secure alerts
- **All-Purpose**: Single- or dual-chamber device with an adaptive activity-sensing accelerometer; both a pacemaker and a defibrillator
- **Convenient**: Can be worn in an MRI machine safely
- **Future-Proof**: Secure encrypted firmware updating
- **Power Longevity**: Precordial remote charging - Recharge the battery through the chest once every 5 years
- **Robust and Rugid**: Designed to outlive the host

This pacemaker is also an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) that is designed for multiple therapeutic uses in treating cardiac arrhythmias. This device is designed to be a one-size-fits-all device for treating most cardiac arrhythmias and conditions. It is rechargeable, designed to be surgically implanted once with remote secure updates, monitoring, and recharging. The source code and hardware schematics are meant to be published open source for widespread auditing for experts in any field to inspect and contribute to the code in order create a uniquely secure and bug-free device.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome. Currently, device manufacturers are needed. This project is still in its pre-alpha stage and is very much still a proof of conccept.
